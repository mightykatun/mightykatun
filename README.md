### 🔭 My Interests & Projects
- **Physics:** Computational models, simulations, and projects that bring together programming and physics. Some of my work focuses on topics like **aerodynamical simulations**.
- **Aviation:** Fascinated by planes and aerodynamics, I often work on projects related to those subjects.
- **Open Source:** I like the idea that what I do could be useful to someone someday, so I try to contribute as much as I can...
- **AI:** It's a subject that has fascinated me for a long time, which means I mess with pytorch in my free time 😂.

### 🔧 Currently Working On
- **[Manim GUI](https://github.com/mightykatun/Manim-GUI)** – Web based graphical user interface for the Manim library.

### 🌱 I’m Currently Learning
- Exploring **advanced algorithms** in **Python** for physics simulations.
- Improving my knowledge of **artificial intelligence**.

### 📂 My Repositories
Here are some of my most notable repositories:
- **[Airfoil Simulation](https://github.com/mightykatun/Airfoil-Flow-Model)** – Computes essential aerodynamic coefficients for airfoil profiles using a robust panel method approach in Python
- **[Super Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/mightykatun/Super-Tic-Tac-Toe)** – Super Tic Tac Toe made with pygame. Was a pain to make 😂. (Especially the compiling to windows part 😝)
